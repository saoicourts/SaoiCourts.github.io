# This is a real conversation I just had 

on a dating app at like 5:30am. Unrelated: this video is great.

I am actually trying with this dating thing here. 
Does it show?

B took the brave first step of messaging me unsolicited. 
I really appreciate that.
I know dudes are supposed to message first and **KEKL I DON'T PAY FOR PREMIUM SO I CAN'T SEE LIKES YOU HAVE TO MESSAGE ME** and shit, but even if you do that it's desolate out there, man.
You just swipe and swipe and swipe and maybe get a nibble.
But the stakes are so low.
For everyone.
Everyone is just passing through and if you don't grab on with both hands they will move on to greener pastures. 
They are but a swipe away.
Sometimes you only get the opening line. 
Sink or swim.
Hope you're better and more eye-catching than the other 45 she got today.

The women's side sounds horrible as well.
I have seen inboxes full of unsolicited genitals and two-syllable grunts soliciting utter debauchery. 🧐
The best most of us hope for is the relationship(s) we desire so that we can finally delete our accounts.
Or at least set it to private mode for a while.

B is cheery and uses smilies in text just like I do :P. 
What an absolute darling.
I shoot off a cordial, if perhaps a bit oversharey, reply that I feel demonstrates some openness and readiness to communicate.
So far so good.
Only the most rabid of dissenters could dredge up reasons why that's not a perfectly nice conversation.
The end!

I just realized I answered **how** instead of **what.**
Well that counts as a strike against me I suppose.
But perhaps a forgivable one.

B has an excellent profile for attracting someone like me.
I want someone who knows who they are and the idiosyncrasies that they need me to put up with.
B gives detailed and personal information right there on their profile, just like I do.
I am here for it.

So I naturally wanted to [demonstrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg5ZrkaGlFA) I had read and connected with her profile.
Start to build some common bonds and language.

At this point starting to feel like ChatGPT's response to

> Write a series of frantic, early-morning dating app messages from a pansexual mess in the midst of an identity crisis.

Here is where I get in a groove a little:

Yeah the Nico train is always full steam ahead on most gender stuff.
Right in the pocket.
May or may not have been necessary to unpack in detail here.
But 'tis my wont.

Also what exactly are these numbers labeling?
This seems like a response to something from the profile.
That is clearly already covered by (2), by friend.
This whole presentation is going to have to be rejiggered.

![five](/assets/images/okc_chat/5.png){:style="display:block; margin:auto;"}

Okay see calm down I had a reason.
{% aside %}
This was all just a grand plan.
What a fool you were to think that I hadn't already reasoned through every possible scenario and computed every move to full Stockfish depth 34 and attained provably optimal play.

It was all in service of me saying that I was a big masc hairyboye.
Was it worth it?
I have now almost completed my twisted dance.
{% endaside %}

Well as you can clearly see above, I have caught myself and started to reel it all in!
The end!

Aha couldn't not talk about the kink aspect, you dog.
She started it though.
It could be a shared passion.

I have to flex a little bit.
But I genuinely believe what I write here and I am kinda a nerd for consent.
I think it's great and important and can be done well and easily to protect people from misunderstandings.
Why *aren't you* a consent nerd? 🤓

I bet you're not even a democracy nerd. 🫠 

![seven](/assets/images/okc_chat/7.png){:style="display:block; margin:auto;"}

She is a sub-leaning switch, I believe. 
Just kinda mentioning some potential rough patches.

Fair. 
But does it need to be all sent as part of a massive conglomerate of "welcome" messages?

![eight](/assets/images/okc_chat/8.png){:style="display:block; margin:auto;"}

You're asking me, buddy?

![nine](/assets/images/okc_chat/9.png){:style="display:block; margin:auto;"}

Whew wow things were going badly but you really saved it at the end there, buster. 
I can't imagine anything except a ghost or a block is in my near future.

Sometimes you're trying to life and a little bit of other life spills out all of a sudden.
It do be like that sometimes.

# In other news
I really just find this pleasing.

Oh and listen to this tune that came on while drafting this.

If you haven't heard Jon Gomm before the first video I shared, watch [Passionflower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY7GnAq6Znw).
It's really excellent.
