I am a Ph.D. student at University of Washington studying representation theory with Julia Pevtsova as well as an intern at Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory studying applications of pure math to machine learning with Henry Kvinge. I am a strong coder, communicator, and 
problem solver and I will be finishing my degree and **looking for a job in June 2022.** I am interested in finding a position where
I can leverage my strong mathematical and research skills to work on real-world problems (likely involving using data to make decisions). 

Please feel free to peruse my site to learn more about me as a student, researcher, and person. I am proud of who I am and am interested 
in finding a position where I can be myself, grow, and help others around me do the same.

**For those looking to meet me,** I plan to attend this year's [Joint Mathematical Meetings](https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2022/2268_intro) (in person) as well as the
[International Conference on Learning Representations](https://iclr.cc/) (online). It is possible I will be giving a talk on [our recent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06983.pdf) at one or both.
