<h2>Hi, I'm Nico.</h2>
<p>
  I am the kind of person to ask the question "why are things the way they are and not some other way?"
  I'm a lover of science and animals and truth and empathy.
  I'm trying to make my way through this life by having the biggest and most positive impact I can have on the lives
  around me and those that will come after.
</p>
<p>
  I am a computer nerd with a love for hardware and software and theoretical computational science.
  I thrive in an environment where I can sense a tangible impact my work is having.
  One of my most cherished skills is the ability to digest and communicate information to non-specialists.
</p>
<p>
  I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://matsen.fhcrc.org/">Matsen group</a> at <a
    href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center</a> studying computational biology related to
  B-cell receptor diversity.
  I don't know what my future career will be exactly, but I plan on continuing to learn and hone my problem-solving
  skills so that I will be prepared to act when the next opportunity reveals itself.
