        This post is currently in the process of being drafted.
        I believe the creative process is of interest in itself, so I have decided to make this site more like a living
        document.
        As such, you should expect that there will be mistakes and content may be added or removed at any time.

        <h1 id="i-hate-politics">I hate politics.</h1>

<p>Ask my friends or my partner or my parents and you might come to believe that I feel differently.
But that’s just because I also happen to think that politics is one of the most important things in our lives.
We are social creatures and everything great (and horrifying) we can attribute to our species is due to our ability to work together to achieve feats far more impressive than any of us could achieve working purely on our own.</p>

<p>So if we are to continue to reach for the highs that living as a society can bring us—roads, science, entertainment, culture—we need to have rules outlining our goals as a collective and detailing how we can protect ourselves from the harms society can create—wars, subjugation, pollution, cruelty.
Politics is just the process for deciding who we are as a society.
Are we base and cruel and child-like or are we enlightened and magnanimous?
Is our purpose simply to continue to expand across the universe unendingly in the pursuit of more materials to consume or perhaps should we focusing on how we can fill the world with love and joy and meaning for the people who are alive right now and are about to be born?
I know which I prefer.</p>

<p>In order for a society to function, people need to contribute. 
Whether you are gathering firewood or farming or working IT or cleaning bathrooms at a Wendy’s, you provide something of value to society in the understanding that society will, in turn, take care of you. 
But there are some jobs, like corporate officers, that don’t really seem to be adding as much to society as they are taking out. 
So if these jobs aren’t benefitting society, why do they continue to exist? 
I argue that it’s because of the way political system of America currently runs: while ostensibly founded on the idea that every (<em>cough</em> white, land-owning, male <em>cough</em>) person should have an equal say in society, in reality, it fails to live up to even this unenthusiastic ideal.</p>

<h1 id="american-democracy">American democracy</h1>
<p>Going to American public school my entire life, I learned in my government and history classes that America was founded on freedom and democracy. 
We were being persecuted for our religious beliefs so we struck out on our own to find a new world. “No taxation without representation,”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> they chanted as they rebelled against the monarchy and insisted they were the masters of their own destinies.</p>

<p>I suppose I have bought in to this framing of things. 
After all, it is an enticing idea! It’s the idea that grows out of a candidate sociological first principle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most equitable arrangement of society is one in which each person reaps the benefits of collaboration in proportion to which their inclusion benefits society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems pretty close to the right idea to me. 
If each person is allowed to to make a decision about whether to be a part of broader society or to remain an individual, it only makes sense that the benefit we are all offered is commensurate with what we add to the pot. 
And of course I am a socialist: when I talk about “what they add to the pot,” I mean the share of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_product">surplus product</a> they generate.</p>

<p>I say “proportion” in the principle above, and I think that is vital. 
<em>The whole is more than the sum of the parts</em> applies when we’re talking about society because in allowing for specialization and cooperation, we exponentially increase the productive capacity for <strong>every individual member</strong> of the society. 
This is a resource we share access to: we can amplify our production by working together. 
I think that we need to share equal access to this resource.</p>

<h2 id="we-arent-as-democratic-as-we-think">We aren’t as democratic as we think</h2>

<p>We aren’t free to leave society, are we? 
If we behave in antisocial ways in the modern world, we remain subject to the laws and norms of societies around us. 
We are implicitly entered into the social contract without any ability to choose whether we feel it is fair and favorable. 
And without that ability we really don’t have any power. 
Sure, if enough people in society decided things were unjust, we could build a critical mass and achieve our ends (through reform or even revolution, if necessary). 
But then the system has an attractor state: the people in control of allocating the surplus product are incentivized to steal as much of it as they can.</p>

<p>They can do this by simply taking as much for themselves as they can while keeping a critical mass of people <em>slightly</em> better off as a part of society than without. 
This can be accomplished by offering true benefits (safety, comfort, engagement, etc) or by more sinister means like propaganda and nurturing dependence and complacency. 
We are not all perfect and rational beings sitting at our keyboards trying to reason through how to structure society (I mean <em>I</em> am, but that’s because I own a website with my name on it). 
We are not all willing nor able to fully grasp the deal we are being offered or willing to consider that things could be any other way. 
We are being held to a contract established for us before we were born and are being coerced into believing we don’t have a choice
Add to that layers of voter disenfranchisement and suppression and a media bent on manufacturing consent for the <em>status quo</em>, and the deal can be further and further from equitable without the boat getting rocked.</p>

<h2 id="failures-of-the-system">Failures of the system</h2>
<p>Did you know that in 2020 a group of public policy experts in the government and from across academia published a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513528/">meta-review</a> on the efficacy of <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/">housing first</a> homelessness policies?
Or that in 2014 the US Interagency Council on Homelessness released <a href="https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/Implementing_Housing_First_in_Permanent_Supportive_Housing.pdf">a fact sheet on housing first policies in permanent supportive housing</a> stating</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] Housing First is a framework that can and should be used within permanent supportive housing, as well as in other program models, and as a community-wide framework for ending homelessness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like a pretty settled issue to me!</p>

<p>In light of that information, let me shoot off a couple of facts for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There were around 11 million “year-round vacant” housing units in the US in 2020.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> This does not count vacation homes but does include vacant rental properties.</li>
  <li>There are about 600 thousand homeless people in the US, including both unsheltered and sheltered (those staying in “emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, or safe havens”)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But certainly we’ve seen a huge decrease in the homeless population since then, right?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ahar_homelessness_estimates.png" alt="Homelessness trends 2007-2022" />
<em>Nope.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></em></p>

<div class="aside"><div><b>Aside: </b></div><div class="hidden-aside" style="display:none;"><p>
<p>Now of course these numbers can’t be taken at face value. 
First of all (assuming we believe that housing markets should exist) we need there to be some “slack” in the market so that it can work properly. 
This takes the form of liquidity: unfilled houses that are available to buy or rent. 
But the largest problem muddying the waters is that people don’t necessarily want to live in the places the housing currently exists. 
This inability of the market to adjust to changes in society (instead of just changes in <em>money</em>) makes it a poorly-suited mechanism to manage our housing development resources, which would respond far better to deliberate planning.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t explain all of it. 
Yes, housing markets in big popular cities (where a majority of unhoused people are) are tighter than on average. 
But even here in Seattle (a city currently experiencing an extreme housing crunch following a huge influx of high-earning tech workers), we had 13,368 sheltered and unsheltered homeless in 2022<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and 22,681 vacant housing units<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> in 2020. 
We’d still have 9000 units left over to allow for market slack. 
The problem is that if you’re an owner of an unoccupied unit, it is likely that, as people move around Seattle, eventually your unit will see income (even if it means an extra unit elsewhere goes empty) before too long.</p>

<p>I hope that the folks at the new Seattle Social Housing Developer make some changes for the good around here. 
But even if they do: this is just crazy, socially-liberal Seattle. 
A bunch of unions and socialists and ecological groups publicly endorsed social housing and <a href="https://www.houseourneighbors.org/">we said</a> “sounds good.” 
Sitting around and waiting for the rest of the country to follow suit is not a viable option.</p>

<p>This paints a dismal picture of our society.
And yet, at least one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_for_Progress">Data for Progress</a> <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/public-option-for-broadband-child-care-housing.pdf">poll in 2020</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.opportunityhome.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tarrance-NLIHC-Poll-Fact-Sheet.pdf">2021 poll</a> from <a href="https://www.opportunityhome.org/">Opportunity Starts at Home</a> suggest that a clear majority of Americans support publicly-owned low-income housing. 
Something is disrupting us from achieving the world we both <em>need</em> and <em>desire.</em></p>

<h2 id="representative-democracy">Representative democracy</h2>
<p>Who’s to blame for the breakdown? 
Why is it that we don’t see the scientifically-based and popular policies like public housing and a woman’s right to bodily autonomy reflected in our laws?
There are many popular ideas that never quite come to be enacted while people suffer needlessly.</p>

<p>Considering these facts makes it clear that the problem is that our representative democracy has failed (or was sabotaged, depending on your point of view) at one of its most fundamental aspects: representativity.
So now that we recognize this disconnect, I think it’s important to figure out how to <em>remedy</em> it.
The entire point of a representative system of government, though, is that the common person doesn’t need to be intricately involved in the minutiae of politics.
Luckily, I think it can be salvaged.</p>

<h1 id="an-alternative">An alternative</h1>
<p>My proposed solution comprises a few parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reimagining of voting and what it means to have your vote heard</li>
  <li>The introduction of a focus on voting on <em>abstract issues</em> and <em>meta-issues</em> rather than on particular pieces of legislation/implementation</li>
  <li>Data-driven ways to directly link the results to the operation of the government.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some difficulties in restructuring things and some new problems we may introduce from restructuring things as broadly as I am suggesting.
I will do my best to address these as they come up below but I always welcome feedback.</p>

<h2 id="tapping-into-the-will-of-the-people">Tapping into the will of the people</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to address is the massive problem of voter disengagement and disenfranchisement that plagues our country today.
“Get out the vote” campaigns and the like can only do so much—the people feel like their voice doesn’t matter or are frustrated by the utter lack of ideological diversity of the two serious candidates that are thrust upon them.
I think that voting should be extremely simple.
I think you should be able to order a burger at a fast food joint and vote from your phone in the time before your number gets called.
I want you to hear a convincing argument for a particular position and be able to seamlessly, instantly register your change of heart so that you can influence policy.</p>

<p>I was always vaguely aware that Estonia had a government-issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI (public key infrastructure)</a> system that was used for identification purposes, but I had never looked at it very closely. It ends up my rough idea for the technological backbone for my proposed system is very closely related to their <a href="https://e-estonia.com/story/">excellent use of technology in government</a>.
So I will instead discuss their system and the aspects that are most relevant to voting.
This video gives you an idea of how their system works:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a0zHU4E1XaE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The key concept is that each resident of the country is given a piece of information that only they have access to (the private key) and everyone (via the government) has access to the corresponding public key. All of the <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/">cool functions</a> of the Estonian ID card basically rely on the facts that</p>

<ol>
  <li>Anyone can verify that a cardholder is who they say they are</li>
  <li>Anyone can encrypt information in a way that only the cardholder can decrypt.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two properties give us a way to have private, secure, and accessible elections.
It’s also important to ensure that the elections are (publicly) auditable!
The standard these days for an auditable ledger is blockchain technology and Estonia uses a technology called <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/cyber-security/ksi-blockchain/">KSI Blockchain</a>, though I had a difficult time locating information on precisely how they use it.
To me, a very simple blockchain-like solution where there is a single audit trail for votes received (perhaps batched every few hours to promote privacy) is the ideal solution.</p>

<p>The flow could go something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user logs into the government voting app on their phone or computer and casts (or updates) their voting preferences.</li>
  <li>The software signs the voting preferences with the voter’s private key and then encrypts this information with the voting authority’s public key.</li>
  <li>The encrypted data is then uploaded using identity verification to the voting authority’s servers.</li>
  <li>Upon receipt, the authority verifies the voter’s e-signature and then determines the correct voting history (one per registered voter) to update.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the collection of “audit logs” of individuals’ changes in voting preferences can be made publicly available so that vote counts can be verified independently and in perpetuity.
There are higher-order levels of trust required (e.g. a way to verify the root of each individual’s blockchain), but I think I will leave more implementation details to a later discussion.
I believe these are largely solved problems, however.</p>

<h2 id="issues-based-voting">Issues-based voting</h2>
<p>So now we have a system that provides a quick and easy way to vote anywhere and at any time, requiring only a connection to the internet.
With such a radical change to the nature of voting, it makes sense to consider whether our current system of voting is the most efficient.
As it stands, we either vote on candidates who are running for particular roles (or candidacy to run for roles, in the case of primaries) or referenda on specific policies and legislation that is crafted in the legislature and presented to the voters.
This works fine as an approximation to true democracy, but the problem is that an individual’s point of view is constantly “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)">quantized</a>.”
An individual votes for a representative who (presumably) embodies a certain set of ideals, but they are very unlikely to have an option that actually represents their viewpoint, meaning that the constituents’ beliefs are homogenized.
If you’ve ever felt that no (or, perhaps worse, only one) politician seems to represent your viewpoint, you’re one of the ones that has fallen through the cracks at this stage.</p>

<p>The problem with voting on specific pieces of legislation is that they are crafted to intentionally be complicated and long and to include carve-outs for special interests to pad the wallets of legislators.
It is unreasonable to expect every voter to read every piece of information, but it is reasonable for them to research and form opinions on particular issues. 
When society faces new problems, interested parties can organize information campaigns to sway voters to their side and debates with their opponents.
I think of this as a centralized, significantly more robust version of polling, where at any moment we can take the temperature of the country and get an authoritative answer on what the people want, and by what margins.
We can call these specific ideological points of contention <em>abstract issues,</em> and we will talk more about how to use this information in the following section.</p>

<p>Abstract issues will be the ones that debates are formed on: when should a human be considered an adult? 
Should marijuana be legal for adults to use? 
Should gay people have the right to legal marriage?
We can effectively end up with a densely-sampled, auditable, and authoritative measure of the ideological landscape of the country and how it changes over time, the perfect platform upon which to build a democracy.</p>

<p>An idea that I think could come in especially handy is that of <em>meta-issues.</em>
These are not about a particular issue facing the values of society, but rather about <strong>how we want the government to proceed in enacting them.</strong>
As a first example, imagine a simple meta-issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should the laws of the United States change or remain the same?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very coarse measure of how happy the populace is with the way things are gives us a metric we can use to determine how difficult it is to pass laws!
We could call the percent of people voting for “change” the <strong>progressivity index.</strong>
As it stands, our constitution and legislative rules favor inertia: most substantive changes require supermajorities that seem to never materialize, even in times of mass popular support for the issue.</p>

<p>Further meta-issues could be a bit more specific: is <strong>&lt;broad issue x&gt;</strong> important to you?
Asking this question for topics such as civil rights, the environment, the economy, infrastructure, etc. can help provide a set of priorities for our leaders to pursue.</p>

      <p>We’re told that one of the primary concerns of the founding fathers is that they were being unfairly taxed on their commerce without being provided adequate political representation.
